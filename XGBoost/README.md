# XGBoost

## Introduction
It stands for “Extreme Gradient Boosting”, where the term “Gradient Boosting” originates from the paper Greedy Function Approximation: A Gradient Boosting Machine, by Friedman.

## What is XGBoost?
XGBoost is an algorithm that has recently been dominating applied machine learning and Kaggle competitions for structured or tabular data. XGBoost is an implementation of gradient boosted decision trees designed for speed and performance. It is a decision-tree-based ensemble Machine Learning algorithm that uses a gradient boosting framework. In prediction problems involving unstructured data (images, text, etc.). A wide range of applications: Can be used to solve regression, classification, ranking, and user-defined prediction problems. It is a perfect blend of software and hardware capabilities designed to enhance existing boosting techniques with accuracy in the shortest amount of time.

Python implementations of some of the fundamental Machine Learning models and algorithms from scratch.

The goal of this project is not to create algorithms that are as streamlined and computationally efficient as possible, but rather to present their inner workings in a clear and usable manner.


## Algorithms:

* Adaboost
* Apriori
* Bayesian Regression
* DBSCAN
* Decision Tree
* Elastic Net
* FP-Growth
* Gaussian Mixture Model
* Genetic Algorithm
* K Nearest Neighbors
* K-Means
* Lasso Regression
* Linear Regression
* Logistic Regression
* Multilayer Perceptron
* Naive Bayes
* Perceptron
* Principal Component Analysis
* Random Forest
* Ridge Regression
* Support Vector Machine
* XGBoost

## Contribution Guidelines ⚙️
You may go through these guidelines and contribute accordingly:

* Make sure you do not copy codes from external sources like GFG, etc because that work will not be considered. Plagiarism is strictly not allowed.
* You can only work on issues that you have been assigned to you.
* If you want to contribute for an existing algorithm, we prefer that you create an issue before making a PR and link your PR to that issue.
* If you have modified/added code work, make sure the code compiles before submitting.
* Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name and push it in correct folder.
* Do not update the README.md.

## Where to upload the files 📂

* Your files should be uploaded inside the *code folder into the corresponding language folder (For instance, if you wrote code for an Algorithm Implementation in Java, it goes inside the code/Java folder).
* **Under no circumstances create new folders within the language folders to upload your code unless specifically told to do so.**
* Edit the corresponding README.md file to add the link to your code in the corresponding section (GitHub Markdown Guide).
